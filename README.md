# Calculations

a The difference in ms between “hablo” and “habló”

``` r
dur_hablo_unstressed - dur_hablo_stressed
```

    ## [1] -1.08

b The difference in ms between the stressed and unstressed \[o\]

``` r
dur_o_stressed - dur_o_unstressed 
```

    ## [1] 58

c The difference in intensity between the stressed and unstressed \[o\]

``` r
int_o_stressed - int_o_unstressed
```

    ## [1] 2.917835

d The difference in F0 between the stressed and unstressed \[o\]

``` r
f0_o_stressed - f0_o_unstressed
```

    ## [1] -3.006483

# Observations

The difference in milliseconds between “hablo” and “habló” is of -1.08
Ms in the same way, we can also observe how the stressed vowel \[o\] has
also a longer duration of 58Ms. Results show that the given speaker
produces longer duration times when pronouncing stressed words.

The intensity between the stressed and unstressed is of 2.917835 dB.
Finally for the difference between the stressed and the unstressed F0 at
the midpoint is of -3.006483 Hz.
