# Calculations

a The difference in ms between “hablo” and “habló”

``` r

d The difference in F0 between the stressed and unstressed \[o\]

# Observations

The difference in milliseconds between “hablo” and “habló” is of -35.079
Ms in the same way, we can also observe how the stressed vowel \[o\] has
also a longer duration of 94.569Ms. Results show that the given speaker
produces longer duration times when pronouncing stressed words.

Regarding the intensity and the F0 distinctions, we find no surprises
here, being the difference in intensity between the stressed and
unstressed of 7.767855 dB, and between F0 stressed and unstressed
133.8392 Hz.
